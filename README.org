* gofer
This gofer is a fork of Mark Jones original with some additions and modifications, the most visible one being the 'Dijkstra dot' for function application.

Mark Jones is gratefully acknowledged for this pioneering work.
* Sample
To see how source looks with these changed syntaxes, look at
[[file:pustd.pre][pustd.pre]].

The alternate prelude [[file:pusimple.pre][pusimple]] is particularly neat for those who feel the need to grok Hindley-Milner before getting into typeclasses. With that you'll get for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
1? :t (+)
(+) : Int -> Int -> Int
? :t (==)
(==) : a -> a -> Bool
#+END_SRC
* Running
You need to have the environment variable set:

=$ PUGOFER=/path/to/pustd.pre gofer=
* Syntax late-bound
You can switch back to classic Haskell syntax with =:s -S=
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
? map.(1+).[1,2,3]
[2, 3, 4] : [Int]

? :s -S
? map (1+) [1,2,3]
[2, 3, 4] :: [Int]

#+END_SRC
* Building
- =cd src=
- Choose the architecture at the top of [[file:src/prelude.h][prelude.h]]
- C compiler in [[file:src/Makefile][Makefile]] 
- =$ make= 
There is no configure to run.\\
Windows seems to build with mingw for 32 bit but not 64.
