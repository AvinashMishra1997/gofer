* gofer
This gofer is a fork of Mark Jones original with some additions and modifications, the most visible one being the 'Dijkstra dot' for function application.
* Sample
To see how source looks with these changed syntaxes, look at
=pustd.pre= or =pusimple.pre= .
'pusimple.pre' is particularly neat if recognizes the need to grok Hindley-Milner before typeclasses
 
* Running
You need to have the environment variable set:
=$ export PUGOFER=/path/to/pustd.pre=

Or

Then run gofer
* Building
Choose the architecture in prelude.c, c compiler in Makefile and run make. There is no configure to run. windows seems to build with mingw for 32 bit but not 64.
* Literature
