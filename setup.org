* Install prerequisites
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential git emacs
#+END_SRC
* Clone gofer
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/rusimody/gofer.git
#+END_SRC
* Build

Above should make a directory called gofer [Usually in your home but that depends on where you ran the git clone ]

cd into gofer/src and run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make
#+END_SRC
* Check executable

Above should make an executable called gofer. When you run it (at shell as:)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./gofer
#+END_SRC
you should get an error that prelude not found

Set the path thus at shell (make sure the path below is correct!)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ export PUGOFER=/home/<yourname>/gofer/pusimple.pre
#+END_SRC
Now gofer should run (at shell) ie
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./gofer
#+END_SRC
should start.
* Emacs Setup
** Directory setup
Make a directory called elisp in ~/.emacs.d
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ mkdir elisp
#+END_SRC
** Copy contents
Copy gofer/emacs/pugofer.el into ~/.emacs.d/elisp directory
Copy gofer/emacs/pugofer-init.el at the end of ~/.emacs.d/init.el
